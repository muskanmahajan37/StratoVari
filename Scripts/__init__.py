The Python repository "StratoVari" contains the scripts, data,
figures, and text for 2 AMIP-style simulations following the
PAMIP protocol for 300 year periods. The model is SC-WACCM4.
We are interested in the internal variability of the 
stratospheric response to Arctic sea-ice loss. In particular, 
is the response statistically robust in a very large ensemble 
(n=300)?
